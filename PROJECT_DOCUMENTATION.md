# 📊 Product Analytics Using SQL

## Google Analytics Public Dataset (BigQuery)

---

## 📌 1. Project Objective

The objective of this project is to perform end-to-end product analytics using real-world user session data from the Google Analytics Public Dataset. The project aims to analyze user behaviour across different stages of the product lifecycle and generate actionable insights related to user conversion, retention, churn risk, and revenue generation.

## 📌 2. Business Problem Statement

An e-commerce organization wants to understand:

* Why users are not converting?
* Which marketing channel drives the highest conversions?
* Which device type performs best?
* How many users return after their first visit?
* Which users are likely to churn?
* What is the lifetime value of customers?

As a Data Analyst, the task is to extract meaningful business insights from user interaction data using advanced SQL techniques.

## 📌 5. Methodology

The following analytical steps were performed using SQL:

### 5.1 Funnel Analysis

Tracked user journey across:
Visit → Product View → Add to Cart → Purchase

Used UNNEST(), CASE WHEN, Aggregation to identify drop-offs at each stage.

---

### 5.2 Traffic Source Analysis

Evaluated performance of marketing channels such as Organic, Direct, Referral, and Paid Search based on conversion rate and revenue generated.

---

### 5.3 Device-Based Conversion Analysis

Compared conversion rates across:

* Mobile
* Desktop
* Tablet

---

### 5.4 Cohort Retention Analysis

Grouped users based on first visit month and tracked their return behaviour in subsequent months to measure retention rate.

---

### 5.5 Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Analysis

Calculated total revenue generated by each user and segmented users into deciles using NTILE() window function.

---

### 5.6 Churn Analysis

Identified users who visited the platform but did not return within 7 days using LEAD() window function and DATE_DIFF().

---

### 5.7 A/B Testing Simulation

Simulated an experiment by segmenting users into:

* Group A (Mobile Users)
* Group B (Desktop Users)

Compared conversion rates and average revenue between groups.

---

## 📌 6. Key Business Insights

* Significant drop-offs were observed at the add-to-cart stage of the conversion funnel.
* Desktop users demonstrated a higher conversion rate compared to mobile users.
* Organic traffic contributed the highest number of users, while paid traffic generated higher revenue per user.
* A majority of users churned within the first week of visit.
* Top 10% of users contributed a significant portion of total revenue.
